<h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Definition of Computer:-</h5>
Computer is an electronic device that
accepts data & information process them & gives
processed output as information. The word “computer”
means “something that computes or “Calculate”. It may be
defined as a device that can operate upon data or
information which is done through the execution of a
program.<br/><br/>
Computer typically performs work in three
well defined steps:-<br/>
- Accepting inputs.<br/>
- Processing rules (program), &<br/>
- Producing output.<br/><br/>
<h5 style="font-weight:bold;"> Data & Information:-</h5>
Data is a collection of facts
unorganized, but able to be organized into useful
information. Data is a raw material of information.<br/><br/>
A collection of class attendance cards is an
example. Data can be manipulated to produce output as
student attendance reports. This output is called as
information, in organized facts that help people to make
decision.<br/><br/>
Data is a raw material used as input to data
processing.<br/><br/>
<h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Program:-</h5>
A program is a sequence of instruction
which operate on data to perform certain task.<br/><br/>
<h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Software:-</h5>
Computer software or simply software is
any set of machine-readable instructions that directs a
computer's processor to perform specific operations.
Without software computer is useless For example: Using
browser (software) you are able to surf internet, by using
anti-virus (software) you are able to protect your computer
from viruses, by using Operating System (Software) we are
able to use computer etc.<br/><br/>
<h5 style="font-weight:bold;"> Hardware:-</h5>
Computer hardware is the collection of
physical elements that constitutes a computer system.
Computer hardware is the physical parts or components of
a computer, such as the monitor, mouse, keyboard,
computer data storage, hard disk drive (HDD), system unit
(graphic cards, sound cards, memory, motherboard and
chips), and so on, all of which are physical objects that can
be touched (that is, they are tangible). In contrast,
software is instructions that can be stored and run by
hardware.<br/><br/><br/>




<h1  class="text-center" style=" margin-top: 100px; font-weight: bold; ">Unit-2 <br/>Types of Computer</h1>
 <h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Analog Computer:-</h5>
Analog computers are used to
process analog data. Analog data is of continuous nature
and which is not discrete or separate. Such type of data
includes temperature, pressure, speed, weight, voltage,
depth etc. These quantities are continuous and having an
infinite variety of values. It measures continuous changes
in some physical quantity e.g. The Speedometer of a car
measures speed, the change of temperature is measured
by a Thermometer, the weight is measured by Weights
machine. These computers are ideal in situations where
data can be accepted directly from measuring instrument
without having to convert it into numbers or codes. Analog
computers are widely used for certain specialized
engineering and scientific applications, for calculation and
measurement of analog quantities.<br/><br/>
<h5 style="font-weight:bold;"> Digital Computer:-</h5>
A Digital Computer, as its
name implies, works with digits to represent numerals,
letters or other special symbols. Digital Computers operate
on inputs which are ON-OFF type and its output is also in
the form of ON-OFF signal. Normally, an ON is represented
by a 1 and an OFF is represented by a 0. So we can say that
digital computers process information which is based on 
the presence or the absence of an electrical charge or we
prefer to say a binary 1 or 0.<br/><br/>
A digital computer can be used to process numeric as well
as non-numeric data. It can perform arithmetic operations
like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and
also logical operations. Most of the computers available<script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

today are digital computers. The most common examples
of digital computers are accounting machines and
calculators. The results of digital computers are more
accurate than the results of analog computers. Analog
computers are faster than digital. Analog computers lack
memory whereas digital computers store information. We
can say that digital computers count and analog computers
measures.<br/><br/>
<h5 style="font-weight:bold;"> Hybrid Computer:-</h5>
A hybrid is a combination of digital and
analog computers. It combines the best features of both
types of computers, i-e. It has the speed of analog
computer and the memory and accuracy of digital
computer. Hybrid computers are used mainly in specialized
applications where both kinds of data need to be
processed. Therefore, they help the user, to process both
continuous and discrete data. For example a petrol pump
contains a processor that converts fuel flow measurements
into quantity and price values. In hospital Intensive Care
Unit (ICU), an analog device is used which measures 
patient's blood pressure and temperature etc, which are
then converted and displayed in the form of digits.<br/><br/>
<h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Super Computer:-</h5>
A supercomputer is a computer
with a high-level computational capacity. Performance of a
supercomputer is measured in floating point operations
per second (FLOPS). As of 2015, there are supercomputers
which can perform up to quadrillions of FLOPS.<br/><br/>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">"The Blue Gene/P supercomputer at Argonne National Lab runs
over 250,000 processors using normal data center air conditioning,
grouped in 72 racks/cabinets connected by a high-speed optical
network"</p>
Supercomputers were introduced in the
1960s, made initially, and for decades primarily, by
Seymour Cray at Control Data Corporation (CDC), Cray
Research and subsequent companies bearing his name or
monogram. While the supercomputers of the 1970s used
only a few processors, in the 1990s machines with
thousands of processors began to appear and, by the end
of the 20th century, massively parallel supercomputers
with tens of thousands of "off-the-shelf" processors were
the norm. Since its introduction in June 2013, China's
Tianhe-2 supercomputer is currently the fastest in the
world at 33.86 petaFLOPS (PFLOPS), or 33.86 quadrillions
of FLOPS.<br/><br/>
<h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Mainframe Computer:-</h5>
Mainframe computers are computers
used primarily by large organizations for critical
applications, bulk data processing such as census, industry
and consumer statistics, enterprise resource planning and
transaction processing.<br/><br/>
The term originally referred to the large
cabinets called "main frames" that housed the central
processing unit and main memory of early computers.
Later, the term was used to distinguish high-end
commercial machines from less powerful units. Most largescale computer system architectures were established in
the 1960s, but continue to evolve. Modern mainframe
design is generally less defined by single-task
computational speed (typically defined as MIPS rate or
FLOPS in the case of floating point calculations), and more
by:<br/>
- Redundant internal engineering resulting in high
reliability and security<br/>
- Extensive input-output facilities with the
ability to offload to separate engines<br/>
- Strict backward compatibility with oldersoftware<br/>
- High hardware and computational utilization
rates through virtualization to support massive
throughput.<br/><br/>
Their high stability and reliability enables these
machines to run uninterrupted for decades.<br/><br/>
<h5 style="font-weight:bold;"> Mini Computer:-</h5>
A minicomputer, is a class of smaller
computers that developed in the mid-1960s. In a 1970
survey, the New York Times suggested a consensus
definition of a minicomputer as a machine costing less than
25,000 USD, with an input-output device such as a teleprinter and at least four thousand words of memory, that
is capable of running programs in a higher level language,
such as Fortran or BASIC. The class formed a distinct group
with its own software architectures and operating systems.
Minis were designed for control, instrumentation, human
interaction, and communication switching as distinct from
calculation and record keeping. During the two decade
lifetime of the minicomputer class (1965-1985), almost 100
companies formed and only a half dozen remained.<br/><br/>
Some popular mini computers in current date are:-<br/>

- HP Compaq Mini 730eo, etc.<br/><br/>
<h5 style="font-weight:bold;"> Microcomputer:-</h5>
A microcomputer is a small, relatively
inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central
processing unit (CPU). It includes a microprocessor,
memory, and input/output (I/O) facilities. Microcomputers
became popular in the 1970s and 80s with the advent of 
increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors
to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were
comparatively much larger and more expensive.<br/><br/>
Some popular microcomputers are:-<br/>
- Intel SIM8-01,<br/>
- Motorola MEK6800D2,<br/>
- Rockwell AIM-65,<br/>
- Synertek SYM-1, &<br/>
- Intel SDK-85, etc<br/>
