                 <h3> Introduction </h3><br/>
Web technologies related to the interface between web servers and their clients. This
information includes markup languages, programming interfaces and languages, and
standards for document identification and display. In general web technology incorporates
tools and techniques for web development.<br/><br/>
Web Development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for
World Wide Web. This can include web design, web content development, client liaison,
client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and ecommerce development. However, among web professionals, "web development" usually
refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding.
Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text
to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, or social
network services.<br/><br/>
Web design is a broad term used to encompass the way that content (usually hypertext or
hypermedia) is delivered to an end-user through the World Wide Web, using a web
browser or other web-enabled software is displayed. The intent of web design is to create a
website—a collection of online content including documents and applications that reside
on a web servers. A website may include text, images, sounds and other content, and may
be interactive.<br/><br/>
For the typical web sites, the basic aspects of design are:<br/>
<strong>The content:</strong> the substance, and information on the site should be relevant to the site and
should target the area of the public that the website is concerned with.<br/>
<strong>The usability:</strong> the site should be user-friendly, with the interface and navigation simple
and reliable.<br/>
<strong>The appearance:</strong> the graphics and text should include a single style that flows
throughout, to show consistency. The style should be professional, appealing and relevant.<Br/>
<strong>The structure: </strong>of the web site as a whole.<br/><br/>
<strong>Internet and its Evolution:</strong><br/>
Internet is a short form of the technical term internetwork, the result of interconnecting
computer networks with special gateways or routers. The Internet is also often referred to
as the Net. The Internet is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure. It
connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which any
computer can communicate with any other computer as long as they are both connected to
the Internet. Information that travels over the Internet does so via a variety of languages
known as protocols. The Internet is loosely connected compared with the randomized
graph.<br/><br/>
The Internet is a globally distributed network comprising many voluntarily interconnected
autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body. However, to maintain
interoperability, all technical and policy aspects of the underlying core infrastructure and
the principal name spaces are administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers (ICANN).<br/><br/>
The history of the Internet starts in the 1950s and 1960s with the development of
computers. This began with point-to-point communication between mainframe computers
and terminals, expanded to point-to-point connections between computers and then early
research into packet switching.<br/><br/>
Since the mid-1990s the Internet has had a drastic impact on culture and commerce,
including the rise of near instant communication by electronic mail, instant messaging,
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) "phone calls", two-way interactive video calls, and the
World Wide Web with its discussion forums, blogs, social networking, and online
shopping sites. (Just go through the brief history yourself)<Br/><br/>
World Wide Web:<Br/>
WWW is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet. The
World Wide Web, or simply Web, is a way of accessing information over the medium of
the Internet. It is an information-sharing model that is built on top of the Internet. The Web
uses the HTTP protocol, only one of the languages spoken over the Internet, to transmit
data. Web services, which use HTTP to allow applications to communicate in order to
exchange business logic, use the Web to share information. The Web also utilizes
browsers, such as Internet Explorer or Firefox, to access Web documents called Web pages
that are linked to each other via hyperlinks. Web documents also contain graphics, sounds,
text and video.<Br/><br/>
The Web is one of the services that runs on the Internet. It is a collection of textual
documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs, transmitted by web
browsers and web servers. The Web is just one of the ways that information can be
disseminated over the Internet, so the Web is just a portion of the Internet. In short, the
Web can be thought of as an application "running" on the Internet<br/><br/>
<strong>What is Hypertext?</strong><br/>
Hypertext provides the links between different documents and different document types. In
a hypertext document, links from one place in the document to another are included with
the text. By selecting a link, you are able to jump immediately to another part of the
document or even to a different document. In the WWW, links can go not only from one
document to another, but from one computer to another
