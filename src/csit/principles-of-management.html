             <h3> Introduction </h3><br/>

ERP is a system for the seamless integration of all
the information flowing through the company such
as finances, accounting, human resources, supply
chain, and customer information . The selection,
procurement, and deployment of an ERP system are
nothing but involvement of high risks in exchange for
significant business and financial rewards . A
successful ERP system can be the backbone of business
intelligence for an organization because it can give
managers an integrated view of the processes involved
within it . The effective ERP implementation brings in
reduction of cost improvement in quality, productivity &
customer service, better resource management,
improved decision-making, planning and hence
organizational empowerment . Despite the wide
spread applications and benefits of ERP systems, the
statistics show that about 30% of ERP implementations
have been successful. In order to overcome failures
through comprehensive literature review 11 critical
factors for successful implementation of enterprise
systems were identified as ERP teamwork and
composition; change management program and culture;
top management support; business plan and vision;
business process reengineering with minimum
customization; project management; monitoring and
evaluation of performance; effective communication;
software development, testing and troubleshooting;
project champion; appropriate business and IT legacy.<br/><br/>

<strong>II. Project management</strong><br/>
ERP is a management mode or techniques.
Many companies regard ERP system implementation as
a project management . The implementation of ERP
projects involves various management functions, which
inevitably leads to different levels of management
reorganizations . Successful project management is
about managing the risk. Project Management is the
application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to
project activities to meet project requirements. This can
be done by using a formal project management structure
(PMS). One of the worlds famous PMS is project
management body of knowledge (PMBOK), which is
developed by Project management institute (PMI). This
methodology includes 5 processes/phases of project
management such as project initiation, planning,
execution, control, and closing. Also it is comprised by 9
knowledge areas such as Project Integration
Management, Project Scope Management, Project Time
Management, Project Cost Management, Project Quality
Management, Project Human Resources Management,
Project Communications Management, Project Risk
Management, and Project Procurement Management.
The results from the study on project management
strategies under PMBOK frame work by Fergal et- al,
illustrates PMBOK as bit fit for ERP projects and also
reveals that the importance of project governance and
the need for a multi-level structure spanning both the
cooperate and local levels. These structures would
ensure the project to be directed properly & focused, and
to reduce delays & rework due to the fact that timely
problem resolution could be carried out.<br/>
Since ERP environment faces constant change
and reassessment of organizational processes and
technology  and hence the project management
method used with ERP deployments must provide
adaptability and agility to support these evolutionary
process and technology . The major problem with
software development/deployment is managerial, but not
technical. Therefore a method of augmenting structured
project methods with agility to produce a new approach
to managing projects is proposed by Alleman . This
method is based on venture capitalist approach which
includes: staged investments, managed risks & people
(team involved). The author discovered that traditional IT
project management waterfall model which includesplanning, change and stability had several erroneous
assumptions. However he suggested that through
planning in the presence of uncertainty, avoiding
dysfunctional relationships and improper pretentions, we
can overcome the flaws in traditional approach. By
applying agile values, author proposed the following
principles for managing ERP projects in agile manner:
assume simplicity, embrace change, enabling the next
effort, incremental change, maximize stakeholder value,
manage with a purpose, multiple views, rapid feedback,
working software is the primary goal and travel light.<br/><br/>


<strong>III. Role of project manager</strong><br/>
Jones et-al explained that the first six out of
sixteen technology factors associated with software
disasters are specific failures in the domains of project
management, and three of the other technology
deficiencies can be indirectly assigned to poor
management practices. The top 10 ERP management
headaches rank issues are project size, staffing, risk
management, unreasonable deadlines, funding,
organizational politics, scope creep, unexpected gaps,
interfaces, and resistance to change . One of the
basic principles for assuring the ERP implementation
success is the appointment of the project manager, who
should be most talented business manager. The
characteristics of a successful project manager are
flexible, disciplined, quick learner, good decision maker,
ERP expert, having business experience, political clout,
good formal education, well liked, and motivates staff
. In order to make ERP project successful, the project
manager must work efficiently in the following areas:
deciding on project scope, managing risks, discovering
gaps, the right staff, preventing brain drain, project
scheduling, interface with other systems, monitoring
progress, and managing chaos[20]. In addition, the
focused management by project manager of the
following critical activities that streamline the ERP project
management will enhance the success of any ERP
project: Embrace overall goals and objectives, defining
requirements, review as is – to be, use proto education,
business system test/conference room pilot(CRP),
execute timely cut-over/conversion processes, and going
live and beyond.
